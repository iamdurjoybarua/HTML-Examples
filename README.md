# HTML Showcase

A collection of fundamental and semantic HTML examples showcasing common web page components. This repository is designed to serve as a quick reference and learning tool for anyone interested in web development.

---

### **Project Overview**

This repository contains three distinct HTML files, each demonstrating a different aspect of modern web page development. The examples are fully functional and can be opened directly in a web browser to see the code in action.

### **Examples Included**

#### 1. **Contact Form**
This file, `contact-form.html`, demonstrates how to build a basic user input form. It includes a variety of form elements and attributes crucial for collecting data.

**Key Features:**
* **Input Fields:** Text, email, and submit button inputs.
* **Textarea:** A multi-line text area for longer messages.
* **Dropdown Menu:** A `<select>` element with multiple `<option>`s.
* **Checkboxes:** A checkbox for user preferences.
* **Labels:** Semantic `<label>` tags linked to their corresponding inputs for improved accessibility.

#### 2. **Data Table**
The `student-data-table.html` file provides an example of a structured data table. It uses semantic table elements to present information in an organized, readable format.

**Key Features:**
* **Table Structure:** The use of `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>` to define the header, body, and footer of the table.
* **Table Rows and Cells:** Proper use of `<tr>` for rows and `<th>` and `<td>` for header and data cells.
* **Cell Spanning:** An example of the `colspan` attribute to make a cell span across multiple columns.

#### 3. **Semantic Page Layout**
This file, `semantic-layout.html`, showcases the power of HTML5 semantic tags to create a structured and meaningful web page layout. This approach improves search engine optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

**Key Features:**
* **Header and Navigation:** Uses `<header>` and `<nav>` for the site's introduction and navigation links.
* **Main Content:** The `<main>` element contains the primary content of the page.
* **Sections and Articles:** `<section>` and `<article>` tags are used to group related content and define self-contained pieces of information (like blog posts).
* **Sidebar:** An `<aside>` element is used for content that is tangentially related to the main content, such as a sidebar.
* **Footer:** A `<footer>` element for copyright information and final links.
